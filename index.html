Watched Fire of Love with Amir. Wasn’t a fan of the stylistic flourishes but absolutely astounding footage from the two volcanologists. What incredible characters, Katia and Maurice Krafft, so steadfast and absolutely in their joint pursuit of volcanoes, not a life for many but I saw kindred spirits in them.

        It’s something of the same compulsion that drives storm chasers I think. A compulsion I’m feeling more and more as I dive deeper into this work. An itch to travel, to document natural forces so much greater than oneself. Stepping away from humanity to get closer to humanity.

Body felt heavy and sluggish, but managed to make the trip to Staten Island to pick up my trail camera. The local geese had wandered all the way out to the post office. I’ve grown quite fond of them over the weeks. Felt a twinge of sadness leaving them for the last time.
        <br><br>
        Read about cloud classification on the bus ride there and back. Studied the illustrations of cumulus clouds from Thomas Forster’s book and looked up to see low hanging nimbus clouds outside the bus windows.

Really nice space, warm vibes—definitely want to spend a lot of time there when I’m back in ny. I told Steve that I was moving soon to start an experimental film program in Milwaukee and he mentioned that the school has great facilities for 16mm and a lot of mutual contacts. Left feeling lifted in spirit and better about leaving the city for now.

        Saw that Natasha had sent me Instagram videos of the rainstorm yesterday. The stairs of a city park looked like an immense waterfall. Much more torrential than the rain I experienced between Sunset Park and Lincoln Center.

        Surprised by sudden rain in the early afternoon, <a href="javascript:;" id="image-link-2" onclick="showImage(event, 2)" class="image-link">overcast skies for the rest of the day.</a> Overwhelming humidity that disappeared as quickly as it came.

        Met Ingrid to watch a Taiwanese film her godfather directed. Not much to note plot-wise but appreciated the aquatic shots and water sounds. The bright orange color of the main character’s fish shop uniform was nice against the other elements. Orange/blue, orange/water, orange/wet, orange/melodrama, orange/loneliness—a synesthesic complementary color theory.

        <a href="javascript:;" id="image-link-1" onclick="showImage(event, 1)" class="image-link">Mostly clear skies.</a> Thought about going to Staten Island to pick up the trail cam but decided to wait for potential rain this weekend. Impromptu gallery visit and long chat with Amir after. Read a nice passage in The Weather Experiment about John Constable and the importance of the sky and clouds in his paintings—found many parallels to film. He liked cumulus clouds for their chiaroscuro effect on the landscape.

        “Madam, I never saw an ugly thing in my life, but light, shade, or perspective would always make it beautiful.” Makes me think of the famous John Cage quote, “If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.” Duration and close-looking.

        <a href="javascript:;" id="image-link-0" onclick="showImage(event, 0)" class="image-link">Clear skies this morning.</a> The city finally feels like it’s officially in spring—flowers in bloom, trees budding, and pigeons marching about. Dom and I took a walk to the promenade and had lunch facing the water. We had just looked through <a href="http://rinkokawauchi.com/en/works/194/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="url-link">Rinko Kawauchi’s Illuminance</a> and the soft light bouncing off the surface of the water brought to my mind her photo of three pigeons suspended against a backdrop of illuminated water.

        Since <a href="javascript:;" id="video-link-1" onclick="showVideo(event, 0)" class="video-link">birds</a> are built to detect the slightest changes in air pressure, they make quite reliable storm forecasters. In New York, storms will often push <a href="javascript:;" id="sound-link-0" onclick="showSound(event, 0)" class="sound-link">rare migratory birds</a> to fly inland so birders have learned to anticipate storms.</div>
