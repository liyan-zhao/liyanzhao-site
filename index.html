        Saw that Kate Bush was topping music charts again and took a deep dive on YouTube. Watched her music video for Cloudbusting, inspired by Wilhelm .

        Came across the ecosex manifesto. "We are aquaphiles, teraphiles, pyrophiles and aerophiles. We shamelessly hug trees, massage the Earth with our feet and talk erotically to plants. We are skinny dippers, sun worshippers and stargazers. We caress rocks, are pleasured by waterfalls and admire the Earth's curves often. We make love with the Earth through our senses. We celebrate our E-spots. We are very dirty."
        <br><br>
        Watched a short film in the evening called The Nest that reminded me a lot of Stephen Gill's The Pillar (a favorite I come back to time and again). Thinking about the single frame, letting landscape hold space and time.

        Bit of an insomniac these days. Listened to the chapter in Rising about Oakwood trying to fall asleep last night. A lot of things I had experienced in person during my visits but also heart-rending descriptions of the aftermath of Sandy and the demoliton of the houses.
        <br><br>
        Reports of more rainstorms in Kentucky, chances of more flash flooding in the coming days.
        <br><br>
        Starting to do some research into the water systems around Milwaukee and came across an interesting NYT piece about Chicago’s changing relationship to Lake Michigan.

        Read a 99pi article on Bermuda rooftops designed to withstand hurricanes and collect fresh rainwater, and how they’re now being imported into other storm-prone areas. Listened to more of Rising—a section on Isle de Jean Charles, Louisiana which loosely inspired Beasts of the Southern Wild. Stories of people who stay behind, who hold on fiercely to the place they’ve lived in their whole lives. Reminders of the families who chose to stay in Bayou Oaks after three consecutive floods in In Too Deep: Class and Motherhood in a Flooded Community.
        <br><br>
        Practiced parallel parking with dad in the evening, getting ready for driving in New York and the unknown streets of Milwaukee.

        Listened to an episode of 99 pi on water today. Descriptions of disembodiment in water, losing one’s body to melt into a collective body.
        <br><br>
        Downloaded an audiobook version of Rising: Dispatches from the New American Shore, which Elijah had recommended. Chapter one talks about the disappearance of the black tupelo tree.
        <br><br>
        “I see them and know that the erosion of species, of land, and, if we are not careful, of the very words we use to name the plants and animals that are disappearing is not a political lever or a fever dream. I see them and remember that those who live on the margins of our society are the most vulnerable, and that the story of species vanishing is repeating itself in nearly every borderland…And if we do not call them by their names we will lose not only the trees themselves but also all trace of their having ever been.”
        <br><br>
        “…learn the names now, and you will at least be able to preserve what is being threatened in our collective memory, if not in the physical world.”

        Drove down to San Marcos to finalize the paperwork on the car. Feels surreal finally having a car of my own after so many years. A whole new world of possibilities open to me, but also the new burden of upkeep costs and responsibilities.
        <br><br>

        Couldn’t use my eyes much all day, caught up on podcasts I haven’t heard in a long time. Highlight was an Audio Long Read episode on wild rice and the rights of nature.

        Day of surgery today, spent all afternoon and evening with an ice pack over my eyes.

Saw a piece that was a collection of water samples taken from all around New York City. Found a sample from Great Kills in Staten Island, close to Oakwood.
        <br><br>
        A vibrant Deana Lawson show at PS1, a blend of staged and chanced life. Intentional omissions and confusions.

        Bo and I took half a tab of acid each which hit us at some point on the ferry ride to Rockaway.

        Finished listening to <a href="javascript:;" id="sound-link-2207221" onclick="showSound(event, 2207221)" class="sound-link">the Audio Long Read episode on flood resilience.</a> Slow water that lingers and gives life, local water. Indigenous beliefs that water and natural entities are living beings entitled to rights. Makes me think of a <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/these-rivers-are-now-considered-people-what-does-that-mean-for-travelers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="url-link">National Geographic article</a> I read about a Canadian river being granted legal personhood. These Indigenous-led conservation tactics are part of a global <a href="https://www.garn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="url-link">rights of nature movement</a>. If corporations are people, why not rivers?

        “We need to see that as humans we are not above the water or the animals. We are part of a whole. When we heal the earth, we heal ourselves, too.”

Thought of geologic time, different scales of time and perspectives, and how to represent these on film.

        Went to the last house class with Cricket at night, bittersweet and touching. We talked about the oral histories of the dance, the gatekeepers, and the passing on of the culture. He advised me to think of my body as an instrument in the music, to take my time with everything, to not be afraid of being late. Dance lessons and life lessons. Embodiment, service, and patience.

        It’s something of the same compulsion that drives storm chasers I think. A compulsion I’m feeling more and more as I dive deeper into this work. An itch to travel, to document natural forces so much greater than oneself. Stepping away from humanity to get closer to humanity.

        Read about cloud classification on the bus ride there and back. Studied the illustrations of cumulus clouds from Thomas Forster’s book and looked up to see low hanging nimbus clouds outside the bus windows. Later received a blog link from Amir that showed the illustrations in color.

        16mm workshop with Steve tonight. First time at Mono No Aware. Really warm and generous space, wished I'd visited earlier. Shot on my Bolex for the first time and realized I need to get a wider lens for it. I told Steve that I was moving to Milwaukee soon for an experimental film program, and he mentioned that the school has great facilities for 16mm and a lot of mutual contacts. Left feeling lifted in spirit and better about leaving the city for now.

        Met Ingrid to watch a Taiwanese film her godfather directed. Not much to note plot-wise but appreciated the aquatic shots and sounds. The bright orange color of the main character’s fish shop uniform popped against the other elements. Orange:blue, orange:water, orange:wet, orange:melodrama, orange:loneliness—a synesthesic complementary color theory.

        Read a passage in The Weather Experiment about John Constable and the importance of the sky and clouds in his paintings. He especially liked cumulus clouds for their chiaroscuro effect on the landscape. Many parallels to film where light is everything. “Madam, I never saw an ugly thing in my life, but light, shade, or perspective would always make it beautiful.”
        <br><br>
         Makes me think of the famous John Cage quote, “If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.”

         Duration and close-looking.
