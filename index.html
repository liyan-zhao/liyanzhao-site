A lesson in camera work and editing. Fluid camera movements, wide-angle close-ups, upward angles, quick cuts between moving shots. Slippage between different spans of time. Glory in the indifference of nature.
        <br><br>
        Saw a terrifying video of a sinkhole in the Bronx that emerged during the rain storm a few days ago. Natural disasters and crumbling infrastructure. Thoughts of pothole-ridden Fox Lane on Staten Island.

        Watched a short by Lucretia Martel that began with a <a href="javascript:;" id="video-link-2207201" onclick="showVideo(event, 2207201)" class="video-link">long time-lapse of a pastoral Argentinian landscape</a>. Thought of geologic time, different scales of time and perspectives, and how to represent these on film. Time-lapse could be a good device to play with, maybe a jarring juxtaposition, quick cuts between time-lapse and slow-motion.
        <br><br>
        Went to the last house class with Cricket at night, bittersweet and touching. We talked about the oral histories of the dance, the gatekeepers, and the passing on of the culture. He advised me to think of my body as an instrument in the music, to take my time with everything, to not be afraid of being late. Dance lessons and life lessons. Embodiment, service, and patience.

Watched Fire of Love with Amir. Wasn’t a fan of the stylistic flourishes but absolutely astounding footage from the two volcanologists. Katia and Maurice Krafft, so steadfast and absolutely in their joint pursuit of the volcanoes they love. The pursuit of scientific knowledge but also some unnameable feeling beyond the rational.

        It’s something of the same compulsion that drives storm chasers I think. A compulsion I’m feeling more and more as I dive deeper into this work. An itch to travel, to document natural forces so much greater than oneself. Stepping away from humanity to get closer to humanity.

The air felt like hot molasses. Body heavy and sluggish, but managed to make the trip to Staten Island to pick up my trail camera. The local geese had wandered all the way out to the post office, the farthest I've seen them. I’ve grown quite fond of them over the weeks. Felt a twinge of sadness leaving them for the last time.
        <br><br>
        Read about cloud classification on the bus ride there and back. Studied the illustrations of cumulus clouds from Thomas Forster’s book and looked up to see low hanging nimbus clouds outside the bus windows. Later received a blog link from Amir that showed the illustrations in color.

        16mm workshop with Steve tonight. First time at Mono No Aware. Really warm and generous space, wished I'd visited earlier. Shot on my Bolex for the first time and realized I need to get a wider lens for it. I told Steve that I was moving to Milwaukee soon for an experimental film program, and he mentioned that the school has great facilities for 16mm and a lot of mutual contacts. Left feeling lifted in spirit and better about leaving the city for now. 
        <br><br>
        Natasha sent me Instagram videos of the rainstorm yesterday. The stairs of a city park looked like an immense waterfall. Much more torrential than the rain I experienced between Sunset Park and Lincoln Center.

        Met Ingrid to watch a Taiwanese film her godfather directed. Not much to note plot-wise but appreciated the aquatic shots and water sounds. The bright orange color of the main character’s fish shop uniform popped against the other elements. Orange:blue, orange:water, orange:wet, orange:melodrama, orange:loneliness—a synesthesic complementary color theory.

        Read a passage in The Weather Experiment about John Constable and the importance of the sky and clouds in his paintings. He liked cumulus clouds for their chiaroscuro effect on the landscape. Many parallels to film where light is everything.
        <br><br>
        “Madam, I never saw an ugly thing in my life, but light, shade, or perspective would always make it beautiful.” Makes me think of the famous John Cage quote, “If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring, then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it is not boring at all.” Duration and close-looking.

We had just looked through <a href="http://rinkokawauchi.com/en/works/194/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="url-link">Rinko Kawauchi’s Illuminance</a> and the soft light bouncing off the surface of the water brought to my mind her photo of three pigeons suspended against a backdrop of illuminated water.

        Since <a href="javascript:;" id="video-link-0" onclick="showVideo(event, 0)" class="video-link">birds</a> are built to detect the slightest changes in air pressure, they make quite reliable storm forecasters.
